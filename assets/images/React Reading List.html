The Nats were in a weird, hybrid, buyer/seller mode, one that necessitated considering a Bryce Harper trade, but moving Kintzler seems to have been about something entirely different. The Nationals, for unknown reasons, had reason to believe that Kintzler was spilling clubhouse tea to reporters.</p></div><div class="card-action"><a href="https://deadspin.com/the-nationals-are-cracking-down-on-their-iffy-clubhous-1828027494" target="_blank">Read Article</a> | <a>Delete Article</a></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col s6 m3"><div class="card"><div class="card-image"><img src="./React Reading List_files/i1sam5nze1067odkdgf5.jpg" alt="placeholder"><span class="card-title">Travis Pastrana Lands Three Incredible Jumps To Break Evel Knievel's Record</span></div><div class="card-content"><p style="color: black;">Over 400 feet of total jumps have been completed by Travis Pastrana tonight in Las Vegas: one jump over 52 cars, one jump over 16 buses, and one jump over the fountain in front of Caesars Palace hotel and casino—breaking three of legendary daredevil Evel Knievel’s most insane records.

I’ve been scrolling and scrolling, but nothing is jumping out at me. It’s like, what’s the point?” Bajaria went on to lament the fact that so many of her favorite subscribers weren’t even on the site anymore.</p></div><div class="card-action"><a href="https://www.theonion.com/netflix-adds-thousands-of-mediocre-new-subscribers-1828028849" target="_blank">Read Article</a> | <a>Delete Article</a></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col s6 m3"><div class="card"><div class="card-image"><img src="./React Reading List_files/17Trump-live14-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="placeholder"><span class="card-title">Trump, at Putin’s Side, Questions U.S. Intelligence on 2016 Election</span></div><div class="card-content"><p style="color: black;">At the end of their first summit meeting, Mr. Trump would not say whether he believes American intelligence agencies or Mr. Putin about Russian electoral interference.</p></div><div class="card-action"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/world/europe/trump-putin-election-intelligence.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news" target="_blank">Read Article</a> | <a>Delete Article</a></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col s6 m3"><div class="card"><div class="card-image"><img src="./React Reading List_files/dvqvi8ezw9jhz5r8budh.jpg" alt="placeholder"><span class="card-title">Kavanaugh Nomination Falters After Washington Post Publishes Shocking Editorial Claiming He Forgot Daughter’s Piano Recital</span></div><div class="card-content"><p style="color: black;">WASHINGTON—In a move that experts believe could upend the confirmation of President Trump’s second Supreme Court justice, the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh had reportedly begun to falter Friday after The Washington Post published a shocking editorial claiming he neglected to attend his eldest daughter’s piano recital in the fall of 2013. “This is exactly the sort of bombshell that a lot of conservative analysts have been worried about,” said NPR political reporter Asma Khalid, noting that several key Republican senators were questioning their endorsement after learning the D.C. Circuit judge had flagrantly decided to work late at the office instead of listening to his then-8-year-old daughter plunk out “The Sleepy Cat” for an audience of students, parents, and faculty. “Susan Collins of Maine, for instance, has already signaled that she has serious doubts about Kavanaugh’s commitment to protecting women’s rights if, as reported, it took him until the following morning to view the iPad footage of his own daughter’s culminating musical performance. Though supporters will claim he put the wrong date in his Google calendar or that he ran into traffic on the way to the school, this black mark on his record has many concerned that Kavanaugh simply does not have the judgment or moral integrity to serve on the nation’s highest court.” Khalid also cautioned that Kavanaugh’s nomination should not be counted out entirely, pointing to a blistering Wall Street Journal opinion piece that failed to derail Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s nomination despite persuasively arguing that she is of Hispanic descent.</p></div><div class="card-action"><a href="https://politics.theonion.com/kavanaugh-nomination-falters-after-washington-post-publ-1827581330" target="_blank">Read Article</a> | <a>Delete Article</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><button class="btn">Logout</button></div><footer class="page-footer grey"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col l12 s12"><p class="white-text center-align">Scott Peterson ©</p></div></div></div></footer></div></div>
